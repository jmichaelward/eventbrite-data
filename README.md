# EventBrite Data - A Custom WordPress Plugin
This is a custom WordPress plugin I'm working on to retrieve private event
data from EventBrite using their REST API. This plugin registers a settings
page within WordPress, along with a pair of functions used to return data
locally via the WordPress REST API (via another plugin - watch this space!).
